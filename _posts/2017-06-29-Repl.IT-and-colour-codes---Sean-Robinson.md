My website gives a personalised answer based on your answers to earlier questions and your answers to the quiz, it is a how normal are you? Quiz. 

I explored into how different colours look on my background, however the site was fairly slow in updating so i couldn't try as many colours as i would have wanted to, but i still managed to get quite a nice shade of orange that looks nice with the green and stands out from the dark blue background.

My quiz i feel made a lot of progress, i experimented a lot and tried several things differently as well as fixing a problem that i had from before, when i worked on it before.
