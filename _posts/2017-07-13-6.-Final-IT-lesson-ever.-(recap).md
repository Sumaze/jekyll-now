From the start of my time at this school, i have done many things in IT lessons, making our own games, designing our own online digital stores, learning about online safety, making our own blogs and quizzes, the list goes on. It has been a fun time, but going into our GCSE courses there is no IT in the schedule.

By the end of this lesson i will have 6 blogs on my new website, one for each week i have been working on it. After today i will most likely not add to my blog again.

My quiz is finished. It is a random quiz which shows how i have manages to give an answer to a certain person and also calculate percentage change using python, on a website called repl.it.
