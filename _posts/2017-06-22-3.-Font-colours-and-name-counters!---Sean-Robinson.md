That is the working text that gives a message based on how long your name is, i feel that it worked well, and i managed to work fairly efficiently and got finished fairly early relative to others.

My website now looks fairly slick, the text is readable, but it looks a bit out of place, the red on a blue background. I plan to keep working on my blog to get it looking more professional, and maybe put a container around the text to make it look more efficiently.
