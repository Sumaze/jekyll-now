I tested a lot of online quizzes for inspiration, and applied some changes to my own to improve it in multiple ways, such as the customizability and additionally i made it a lot more personal, and it will now, hopefully, increase the personalization of the quiz, and it includes answers to earlier questions in the end product.

Sometimes there are grammar errors, for example it might depend on if the person taking the quiz writes football or playing football, it can cause errors, i hope to fix this next lesson
